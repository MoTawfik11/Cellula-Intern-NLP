LangChain is a Python framework for building applications that use large language models (LLMs).
It provides modular components for chains, agents, retrievers, memory, and vector stores.

LangChain simplifies building Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems by providing integrations with
OpenAI, Chroma, and FAISS. It also supports ConversationBufferMemory to maintain dialogue context.
