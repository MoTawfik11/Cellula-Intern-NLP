Common evaluation metrics for RAG systems include:
- Precision@K: Measures how many of the top-K retrieved documents are relevant.
- Recall@K: Measures how many of the total relevant documents are retrieved in top-K.
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): Evaluates ranking quality by averaging the reciprocal of the first relevant result's rank.
- nDCG (normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain): Evaluates ranking quality with graded relevance.

These metrics ensure that retrieval brings the most relevant knowledge to the generator.
