Chroma is an open-source vector database used to store and query document embeddings locally.
It provides persistence, meaning the database remains on disk between runs.

In LangChain, you can build a Chroma store from a set of text documents, persist it locally, 
and use it as a retriever in your RAG pipeline.

Chroma supports metadata filtering and fast similarity search across embeddings.
