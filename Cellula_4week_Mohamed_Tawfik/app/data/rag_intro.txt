Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that improves language model accuracy
by combining retrieval and generation. 

Instead of relying purely on its own training data, the LLM first retrieves relevant external documents
using a vector database (like Chroma or FAISS) and then generates an answer based on both the retrieved
context and its internal knowledge.

This ensures factual accuracy, transparency, and up-to-date answers.
