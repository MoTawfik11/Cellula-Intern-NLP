DeepEval is a Python framework used to evaluate LLM and RAG systems.
It measures how accurate, faithful, and grounded the generated answers are.

It provides built-in metrics like FaithfulnessMetric, AnswerRelevancyMetric, and ContextPrecisionMetric.
DeepEval integrates directly with LangChain pipelines for structured testing.
